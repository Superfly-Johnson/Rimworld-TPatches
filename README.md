# Rimworld-TPatches
Many fixes, tweaks, settings and mod compatibility patches. Everything is toggleable. Made using XML Extensions!

It is a framework which allows me to add new toggleable patches into mod settings with as little effort as just writing a patch.

## Info
Requires [XML Extensions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574315206).

Imranfish's XML Extensions is an incredible modding tool, using it I made a "framework" which automatically creates a fancy setting entry for each patch I make. If you have any suggestions, I can now very easily implement them into the mod.


Load as low as possible! TPatches only affects mods loaded before it.

To access settings menu, go to rimworld settings and press the "More Mod Settings" button which is added by XML Extensions.
