# Rimworld-TPatches
Many fixes, tweaks, settings and mod compatibility patches. Everything is toggleable. Made using XML Extensions!

It is a framework which allows me to add new toggleable patches into mod settings with as little effort as just writing a patch.

## Bugs
- Rottable items filter doesn't include meat. That is because meat is not defined in xml and there is no way to modify it without c#.
