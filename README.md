## Implemented
- Duplicate Animal Remover - Removes duplicate animals if you have certain combinations of mods. VE animals are the highest priority and won't be removed. When a higher priority mod is detected, it tries to remove duplicate animals from lower priority mods. For example, if both VE and ACP add a Cheetah, it will be deleted from ACP. You can see the mod priority on TPatches Google Sheets. Currently supports Vanilla Expanded, Erin's Wildlife, Erin's Mountain Animals, Biomes! Core(stripped), Biomes! Islands (stripped), HC_Animal_1, HC_Animal_2, HC_Animal_3, HC_Animal_4, Animal Collab Project Vanilla-Style.
- Typo Correcter - Corrects text typos in mods. Currently does a complete retranslation of HC_Animal_1, HC_Animal_2, HC_Animal_3 and HC_Animal_4.
- fix factions not showing in create world menu - Some modded factions don't appear in create world menu, this patch fixes that.
- HAR thoughtSettings Remover - removes all custom thoughts from HAR races. Good for making races more balanced and also might slightly improve your performance
- HAR Research Restrictions Remover - Removes research restrictions from HAR races. Useful if you use Random Research because it can choose a research your race can't research and you will be stuck on it
